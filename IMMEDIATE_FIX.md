# ðŸš¨ IMMEDIATE FIX for Railway Deployment

## Current Issue
Your app is deployed but showing `DisallowedHost` error because Railway assigned a different domain than expected.

## âœ… Quick Fix (2 minutes)

### 1. Go to Railway Dashboard
- Visit your project at [railway.app](https://railway.app)
- Click on your project

### 2. Update Environment Variable
- Go to **"Variables"** tab
- Find `ALLOWED_HOSTS` variable
- Update its value to:
```
smart-housing.railway.app,healthcheck.railway.app,*.up.railway.app,localhost,127.0.0.1
```

### 3. Redeploy
- Click **"Deploy"** button
- Wait for deployment to complete

## ðŸŽ¯ Your App URLs

After the fix, your app will work on:
- **Primary**: https://web-production-fdc00.up.railway.app/
- **Custom**: https://smart-housing.up.railway.app/ (if you set up custom domain)

## ðŸ”§ What the Fix Does

The `*.up.railway.app` wildcard allows your Django app to accept requests from any Railway-generated domain, including:
- `web-production-fdc00.up.railway.app` (your current domain)
- Any future Railway domains
- Healthcheck domains

## ðŸ“‹ Complete Environment Variables

Make sure you have ALL these variables set:

```
DJANGO_SECRET_KEY=a-#gqkp7ug+hs7ma05-n!ser_p*m@)lq4c!rtn&)q_9%0xwu4-
DEBUG=0
ALLOWED_HOSTS=smart-housing.railway.app,healthcheck.railway.app,*.up.railway.app,localhost,127.0.0.1
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379/0
```
